Ongoing project that supports stroke patients who struggle to move their hands and have lost control of their hand. 
 It allows for simultaneous opening and closing of the hand using four links connected to the transmission shaft.
 Motion is transmitted to the shaft by gears connected to the servo motor, which is controlled by EMG and FSR sensors. 
 Comparisons will be performed using both the sensors.
